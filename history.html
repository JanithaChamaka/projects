        <p>
            …with a gentle swish another wave met the long sandy shoreline, welcoming another dawn. In the far distance, a solitary man stood gazing out to the brightening horizon. This was a beach he knew inside out, a stretch of coast he loved dearly. He had found his space; being naturally generous, he longed to share it – and so, he dreamed of what it could be, one day…                                       
            
            It was another day on the Negombo beach in the early 1970s; he was Herbert Cooray – a visionary, a pioneer of tourism in Sri Lanka and the founding father of Jetwing. The homely villa he built and named Blue Oceanic of just six rooms may have been small, but the heartfelt warmth it offered was immense. It all began with a humble desire to share the experience of true hospitality of a Sri Lankan family with others. A simple dream which grew to an ever furthering vision that made us – the company he founded, what we are today – one of the largest, most respected, and recognized tourism organisations in Sri Lanka, and a family of hotels like no other.
            
                
            
            United at heart, we live by the ‘family’ values of passion, humility, integrity and tenacity – tenets that set us apart as a strong, family run business of distinction. Traits shared by all at Jetwing – a team of dedicated people who believe in the ethos of caring, and who strive to be better than their best. And together, we grow as one big family.
            
            As a renowned specialist in travel and tourism, over the past 40 years and more we have nurtured a hospitality culture that is wholly Sri Lankan, striving to make it legendary. Ever opening new doors we continue to deliver novel experiences through innovative, niche products which embrace all who visit us with the aura of total comfort and peace – a sense of warmth that is unmistakably Jetwing. Staying true to our pioneering spirit, we stray from the well-trodden path, consistently creating new destinations on the map – expanding our horizons – and our visitors’, while enriching the lives of local communities and bringing better prospects for all.
            
            Distinct in identity and unique in personality, pioneering discoveries encompasses the very essence of our brand. With a wealth of knowledge gained over the years, we are specialists – experts in legendary Sri Lankan hospitality, so be assured that you are indeed, in very good hands. At the heart of our being is a deep rooted respect for all – people and nature; making us essentially family centred, culturally sensitive and environmentally conscious. Trust is a quality inherent in us, a value we abide by. Always ethical and fair we believe firmly in the importance of integrity. Proud of our origins, our inheritance and our culture, we are wholly Sri Lankan to the very core – staying true to our reputation as a trailblazer, an entrepreneur and a pioneering spirit that continues to lead the industry with ever-raising standards of excellence.
            
            
            
            We take immense pleasure and great pride in sharing our home and showing our country to visitors from around the world. And you will discover the difference from the moment you arrive. To us, you are never, ever a room number. You will never just stay with us, but you will experience. You may arrive as a visitor, but you will always leave as friends – and return as family.
            
            At every Jetwing home, you will find our values reflected in terms of spaces: open spaces reflect freedom in architecture and in attitude; our respect for nature is echoed in spaces that showcase the environment, promote synergy – bringing the inside out, inviting interaction. Every space, also tells a story: celebrating the culture and heritage of our country. Spaces – that invite you to make yourself at home – at our home.
            
            Long years ago, we were born to create unique Sri Lankan spaces, and we continue today to help the world experience the best our country has to offer to all on a journey of discovery. Meet us and get to know more about us in person. Our doors are open – our home awaits you, come find your space.</p>
